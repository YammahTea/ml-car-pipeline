# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

A robust Machine Learning pipeline designed to predict used car prices based on various features. This project bridges the gap between **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Production Deployment** by separating research code from the final training pipeline.

# 📌 Project Overview

This project processes over **21,000 car records** to build a predictive model. It handles complex preprocessing steps automatically, ensuring the model can handle raw user input in production without crashing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies


**Languages & Environment:**
* ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue) **Python**
